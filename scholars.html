    <h1>Oxford-Canada Scholars</h1>
    <p>In addition to our current scholar, we are grateful that a number of our past scholars have allowed us to post notes on their academic and subsequent careers.  While only a few of the over 100 scholars, whom the Foundation has sponsored since 1956, they give some insight into the wide range of disciplines and subsequent contributions of our alumni.</p>

Mr. Runacres says that, "the Oxford-Canada Scholarship and two years in Vancouver completely liberated me intellectually and personally. My work there branched off in various unexpected and enjoyable angles under broad-minded but challenging supervisors, and resulted in an article on outrageous violence in Lucan and his seventeenth century imitators. A book chapter on political cartoons, which I co-wrote with a friend in political science, would never have been written without the inter-disciplinary melting pot of Green College. I made a lot of fun friends, swam in the ocean every day, and now have an enduring love of Winnipeg in winter."</p>

				<p>Alison Etheridge graduated with a BA in Mathematics from New College, Oxford, in 1985. As the
Oxford-Canada scholar, she researched mathematical probability, at McGill, in 1985/86. Of her time in
Canada, she writes, it made a huge difference to my life. Not only did the scholarship provide a huge
boost to me as a mathematician, but it broadened my horizons dramatically and left me with a lifelong
affection for Canada. Becoming relatively fluent in French was an added bonus that has served me
extremely well over the years.</p>
        <p>Dr. Etheridge returned to New College, in 1987, as the Junior Fellow and Tutor for Women. Then, armed
with an Oxford DPhil, she worked in Cambridge, Edinburgh, UC Berkeley and QMUL, before joining
Magdalen as a Tutorial Fellow in mathematics in 1997. In 2012, she resigned her Tutorial Fellowship
to take up a new position in the University, where she is an Associate Head of the Mathematical,
Physical and Life Sciences Division. She remains associated to Magdalen as a Fellow by Special
Election.</p>
        <p>Dr. Etheridge is the author of numerous books and articles. Of her work she writes, While at McGill, I
was drawn further into probability theory and began working on the mathematical objects now known
as superprocesses. Although drawn to study superprocesses by their rich and beautiful mathematical
structure, I see them as having provided a first taste of modelling biological populations. Although my
work is still highly mathematical and much of it is still driven by mathematical beauty, most recently
my central interest has been a collection of mathematical problems arising in theoretical population
genetics.</p>

				<p>Dan Corry graduated with a BA in Politics, Philosophy and Economics from University College,
Oxford, in 1983. As the Oxford-Canada scholar, he completed an MA, in Economics, at Queen's, in
1984. He says, “I had a very enjoyable year at Queens. That knowledge and way of approaching
problems has been crucial throughout my career, as a civil servant, a think tanker, a political policy
adviser and now working to help charities improve. It also created lifelong friendships with many
Canadians, who I still see to this day.”</p>
        <p>Mr. Corry became Chief Executive of NPC (a charity think tank and consultancy that advises charities and
funders), in 2011, following a variety of posts in public policy and economics. He was Head of the
Number 10 Policy Unit and Senior Adviser to the Prime Minister on the Economy from 2007 to 2010.
Corry had been Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Treasury and worked as a special
adviser to the Secretary of State in the Education Department, as well as at DTI and DCLG. He was a
Director in the Economics segment of FTI Consulting. He ran the New Local Government Network
think tank between 2002 and 2005, and was Senior Economist at the IPPR in the 1990s.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corry is a member of the Early Action Taskforce, which helps make the case for a shift in priorities
away from coping with the consequences of social problems towards work that prevents them arising.
He is a member of the Advisory Boards for Big Society Capital , Impetus–PEF , and the Centre for
Public Scrutiny , as well as a member of the Charity Tax Commission. He is a Visiting Fellow at
Southampton University, a trustee of St Mungo's and of the What Works Centre for Wellbeing , and a

				<p>Peter Barker graduated with a BA in Chemistry from Balliol College, Oxford, in 1982. As the Oxford-
Canada scholar, he studied chemistry for a year at UBC, working on nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy. There, he says, "I published my first scientific paper (<u>NMR of deuterium in liquid crystal
mixtures</u>, Chem Phys Lett, 1984), played cricket in Stanley Park, learned what it means to ice the puck,
made some life-long friends and met my future ex-wife. The CRSF scholarship," he continued,
"launched me on a career in science working with NMR spectroscopy".</p>
        <p>Dr. Barker returned to Oxford to complete his D.Phil in Physical Chemistry (1986), did a post-doc at
Caltech/Huntington Medical Research Institute in Pasadena, CA, and in 1989 moved to the Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD, as an assistant Professor of Radiology. During his post-doctoral
fellowship, his research focus switched from chemistry to medicine, still using magnetic resonance
technology (i.e. MRI). Still at Johns Hopkins 29 years later, he is in charge of a group of a dozen
faculty members, post-docs and graduate students researching on human brain metabolism. He has
published about 300 papers and written three books on MR imaging and spectroscopy, published by
Cambridge University Press.</p>
