        <p>Mr. Knowles recently moved to Denmark to live with his partner as she begins an exciting career in pharmaceutical research in Copenhagen. It is a fortuitous move, as Kierkegaard’s influence on the shape of the postwar American novel features prominently in his research. He will, however, return to Vancouver in the near future to complete and defend his dissertation. He writes that having been an Oxford-Canada Scholar, 'remains one of the great privileges of my academic life. I look back on my time with the fondest memories. Studying in Canada was tremendously important to my later studies, as it allowed me to work on material that was simply not on my radar in the UK. Similarly, the opportunity to move to the intellectual excitement of Toronto after I finished my BA opened up whole new worlds. I will always be grateful.’</p>

thoroughly colourful and energetic city with a lively arts and music scene, an international
profile, and an altogether friendly and welcoming environment in which to live. It was my
kind of place. The University of Toronto as an intellectual home was a supportive and
stimulating experience in every way, and the Centre for Medieval Studies was a powerhouse
of talent. I really was exceptionally lucky to spend time there in my early 20s, and my
positive experiences in Canada have shaped me fundamentally, both as a person and as an

particularly its wonderful founding director, Michael Howarth, who over the years was

His remarkable dedication and energy made this unique scheme what it is today. I am

was drawn further into probability theory and began working on the mathematical objects now known
as superprocesses. Although drawn to study superprocesses by their rich and beautiful mathematical
structure, I see them as having provided a first taste of modelling biological populations. Although my
work is still highly mathematical and much of it is still driven by mathematical beauty, most recently
my central interest has been a collection of mathematical problems arising in theoretical population
genetics.</p>

				<p>Dan Corry graduated with a BA in Politics, Philosophy and Economics from University College,
Oxford, in 1983. As the Oxford-Canada scholar, he completed an MA, in Economics, at Queen's, in
1984. He says, “I had a very enjoyable year at Queens. That knowledge and way of approaching
problems has been crucial throughout my career, as a civil servant, a think tanker, a political policy
adviser and now working to help charities improve. It also created lifelong friendships with many
Canadians, who I still see to this day.”</p>
        <p>Mr. Corry became Chief Executive of NPC (a charity think tank and consultancy that advises charities and
funders), in 2011, following a variety of posts in public policy and economics. He was Head of the
Number 10 Policy Unit and Senior Adviser to the Prime Minister on the Economy from 2007 to 2010.
Corry had been Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Treasury and worked as a special
adviser to the Secretary of State in the Education Department, as well as at DTI and DCLG. He was a
Director in the Economics segment of FTI Consulting. He ran the New Local Government Network
think tank between 2002 and 2005, and was Senior Economist at the IPPR in the 1990s.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corry is a member of the Early Action Taskforce, which helps make the case for a shift in priorities
away from coping with the consequences of social problems towards work that prevents them arising.
He is a member of the Advisory Boards for Big Society Capital , Impetus–PEF , and the Centre for
Public Scrutiny , as well as a member of the Charity Tax Commission. He is a Visiting Fellow at
Southampton University, a trustee of St Mungo's and of the What Works Centre for Wellbeing , and a
former member of the Research Committee of the ESRC and of the Greater Manchester Economic
Advisory Panel.</p>

				<p>Peter Barker graduated with a BA in Chemistry from Balliol College, Oxford, in 1982. As the Oxford-
Canada scholar, he studied chemistry for a year at UBC, working on nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy. There, he says, "I published my first scientific paper (<u>NMR of deuterium in liquid crystal
mixtures</u>, Chem Phys Lett, 1984), played cricket in Stanley Park, learned what it means to ice the puck,
made some life-long friends and met my future ex-wife. The CRSF scholarship," he continued,
"launched me on a career in science working with NMR spectroscopy".</p>
        <p>Dr. Barker returned to Oxford to complete his D.Phil in Physical Chemistry (1986), did a post-doc at
Caltech/Huntington Medical Research Institute in Pasadena, CA, and in 1989 moved to the Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD, as an assistant Professor of Radiology. During his post-doctoral
fellowship, his research focus switched from chemistry to medicine, still using magnetic resonance
technology (i.e. MRI). Still at Johns Hopkins 29 years later, he is in charge of a group of a dozen
faculty members, post-docs and graduate students researching on human brain metabolism. He has
published about 300 papers and written three books on MR imaging and spectroscopy, published by
Cambridge University Press.</p>
