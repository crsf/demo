		<h1>History of the Canadian Rhodes Scholars Foundation</h1>
	    	
        <p>From the Foundation's archives<br />[Editor's Note: The history of CRSF presented below was written by E. Michael Howard in 1993.<br />The author published an update in 2006 also presented in these pages. Library and Archives Canada<br />holds a collection of CRSF archives.]<br />The Canadian Rhodes Scholars Foundation Scholarships<br />A review of the first 37 years 1957-93<br />Introduction<br />Customarily, when historical reviews of institutions are commissioned, the titles have a nice, round<br />ring, such as &amp;quot;25 Years&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;44 Years&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;50th Anniversary&amp;quot;. Nevertheless, it does seem appropriate<br />that this review of the Foundation Scholarships be undertaken while I still have easy access to the<br />records and while my memory of the earlier stages is still fresh. Members of the Canadian<br />Association of Rhodes Scholars have been kept abreast of the scholarship program by regular<br />reports; in the Newsletter, at Biennial Reunions, and by the literature accompanying the various<br />campaign mailings. This review, however, will attempt to bring together the salient features of the<br />story, from its tentative beginnings to the impressive developments of recent years.<br />The Founders<br />The primary and vital role played by Nova Scotian Rhodes Scholar Ralph Henson has been<br />frequently described. In 1956, he informed the Association that he had long planned to finance a<br />year of post-graduate study for an Oxford student at a Canadian university, - in recognition and<br />reciprocal acknowledgement of his Rhodes Scholarship. To some, this generous gesture might seem<br />to have been commendable, but not, perhaps, necessarily remarkable. To the best of my knowledge,<br />however, Henson was the first and only Rhodes Scholar, of some 3,000 who had been appointed by<br />that date, to have experienced such a sense of gratitude and privilege that he felt impelled to do<br />something tangible in return, even to the extent of taking personal and, if necessary, independent<br />action.<br />From the Association's standpoint, Henson's timing could hardly have been better. Established some<br />five years earlier in Montreal and dedicated to the support and encouragement of the Rhodes<br />Scholarships, the Canadian Association had yet to identify and sponsor a worthwhile project which<br />might stimulate interest and, perhaps, serve to coalesce the membership. Henson's offer to<br />underwrite such a scholarship, under its aegis, provided the needed kick-start and, as the pundits<br />invariably say, the rest is history.<br />Henson's inspiration and generosity would not however, have produced anything more than an<br />intriguing one-shot event, without the enthusiastic and imaginative involvement of two men who<br />became the key players in the conversion of an admittedly attractive concept into an effective and<br />enduring reality. Before a scholarship program could hope to get off the ground two essential<br />requisites had to be explored and confirmed. Since the proposed Scholars were to be sought,<br />scrutinized and selected in Oxford, it was necessary to ensure that the Rhodes Trust and Rhodes<br />House were onside. The idea was broached to Lord Elton, then Secretary of the Trust, by<br />Association President.<br />[1993]</p>
        <p>J R Stewart, who had personally undertaken to spearhead the project. Elton's immediate response<br />was both favourable and enthusiastic, but this still left a matter of extreme importance to be<br />resolved on the home turf.<br />This second key requisite for a scholarship program, to be financed by contributions from Canadian<br />Rhodes Scholars, was tax-deductibility; a matter much easier envisaged than sanctioned. The first<br />step was to incorporate the Canadian Rhodes Scholars Foundation. The founding Directors were<br />Stewart, Henson, Roly Michener, Ian Wahn and myself, with Stewart and I becoming, respectively,<br />President and Secretary-Treasurer, offices which .,we currently held in the Association.<br />Letters Patent were sought and granted in May 1957, which cleared the way for the next hurdle-an<br />approach to Revenue Canada for recognition as a &amp;quot;Charitable Organization&amp;quot;, with the consequent<br />authority to issue tax-deductible receipts. Perhaps Stewart, who knew his way around Ottawa, had<br />some qualms about the readiness of Revenue bureaucrats to approve an organization which baldly<br />stated that its purpose was to provide benefits to &amp;quot;foreign&amp;quot; students, and this may account for the<br />rather general objectives outlined in our application for Letters Patent. Under the heading &amp;quot;Purposes<br />and Objects&amp;quot;, it reads:<br />&amp;quot;to promote the advancement of higher education in Canada and (rather surprisingly) to relieve<br />poverty among alumni of universities, their spouses and their dependents in Canada and to receive<br />contributions without any public appeal&amp;quot;.<br />In any event, our application was approved and the two vital elements were now in place. By<br />autumn of 1957, our first Foundation Scholar, Joseph Youll of Worcester, was enrolled in the<br />School of Business Administration at Western; and our first quadrennial campaign (for $10,000)<br />was launched with considerable trepidation. Elton personally arranged for the first two<br />appointments and, following the Trust's decision to combine the offices of Secretary and Warden,<br />his pioneering work has been enthusiastically and effectively carried forward by successive<br />Wardens Bill Williams, Robin Fletcher and, at present, Tony Kenny. To date 55 foundation Scholars<br />have been appointed. To the extent that they value this experience, and there is strong evidence to<br />suggest that they do, they have been beneficiaries, not only of Ralph Henson's initial inspiration, but<br />also of the imagination and dedication of Jack Stewart and Godfrey Elton, who combined to provide<br />the essential Boswell to Henson's Johnson.<br />Financing the Scholarship<br />In order to provide stability for the proposed scholarship program, it was decided at the outset to<br />campaign only at four-year intervals. This had an added advantage in that it substantially reduced<br />campaigning costs and the attendant administrative burden, which would, inevitably, fall on just a<br />few voluntary shoulders. This has proven to be effective and acceptable. Some 95% of our<br />contributions come from pledges, or from donors who because, as he put it, &amp;quot;Yours is the only<br />group I have known, who, having themselves enjoyed an award, have felt disposed to do something<br />in return&amp;quot;.<br />On a more prosaic level the Foundation has never incurred an expense for office space, furniture,<br />telephone or staff; and its Directors have always absorbed out-of- pocket expenses for long-distance<br />calls and travel. In the economic jargon of the Keynesian era one often heard reference to the<br />&amp;quot;multiplier effect&amp;quot;. It would now appear to have gone out of fashion, but something akin to it seems<br />to have been at work for the Foundation.<br />Recognition in Oxford<br />In 1957, the announcement of a scholarship to Canada fell somewhat short of causing an overnight</p>
        <p>sensation in Oxford. Lack of awareness certainly affected the size, and at times, the quality, of the<br />field in the early years and there were occasions, in the 1960s and 1970s, when no appointment was<br />recommended. Since 1976, however, there have been one or more appointments every year.<br />Foundation Scholars have come from 23 Colleges. Brasenose and University lead, with six each,<br />but Lady Margaret Hall is coming up fast on the outside, having gained three of the last four<br />awards, sending us Firsts in Modem History, Jurisprudence and English. During the past two years,<br />there have been as many as 20-odd applicants and, as frequently occurs with Canadian Selection<br />Committees, our Oxford representatives have, on occasion, regretted being unable to make more<br />than two recommendations.<br />Given their solid academic results (four Firsts and one High Second 1991/r92) and the enthusiastic<br />support of their College sponsors, our Scholars have never experienced difficulty in gaining<br />acceptance by their chosen Canadian universities. Toronto has been the most popular choice with<br />18, followed by UBC with 11, then McGill and Queen's with five each. The balance of 13 has been<br />dispersed among seven universities extending from Memorial to Simon Fraser. At present, in<br />addition to the four stipendiary Scholars, five recent Scholars are proceeding to doctorates here<br />under other auspices, such as a NATO Research Council Award and a University of Alberta PhD<br />scholarship. Most of our Scholars stay the full two years, but one 1991 appointee returned to Oxford<br />after one year, to take up a British Academy Fellowship. The proportion of female applicants, while<br />relatively low at first, has grown in recent years and, since 1986, they have accounted for one-third<br />of the awards.<br />The Scholars<br />Someone once said that selecting Rhodes Scholars was tantamount to handicapping a horse race<br />which would not be run for another 20 years! The same challenge has been faced by our Oxford<br />committee, hut, as a confirmed, but hardly disinterested, &amp;quot;Scholar Watcher&amp;quot; over a span of nearly<br />four decades, I am prepared to venture some general observations. Apart from a remarkable<br />proclivity, among the men at least, to write indecipherable letters, my most lasting impression has<br />been of their outgoing personalities. Over and above their academic performance these soft-spoken<br />extroverts have been active<br />Officers and Directors<br />Throughout its history, the Foundation has benefitted immeasurably from the dedication of those<br />who have served on its Board of Directors. The vital contribution of such stalwarts as Ralph<br />Henson, Jack Stewart and Ian Wahn has been described in some detail, but the story would be<br />incomplete without special mention of two, who provided most valuable leadership and continuity.<br />Roly Michener, a founding Director served for 26 years, giving valued guidance throughout this<br />period. Ian Macdonald, who is now in his 21st year on the Board, completed six years as President<br />in 1992. Ordinarily, presidents of charitable organizations lend their prestige and support, but are<br />rarely expected to participate in ongoing day-to- day affairs. Not so with the Foundation, where<br />hands-on involvement is the rule. During Ian Macdonald's tenure the demands on the President<br />increased substantially as a result of the expansion of the Scholarship program, following receipt of<br />the Henson Bequest and the attendant responsibility of directing a much enlarged financial<br />operation. He served as chairman of the 1989 campaign and also spearheaded efforts designed to<br />increase contact between Foundation Scholars and Rhodes contributors, both present and potential.<br />Towards this end, a variety of social functions, generously hosted by local Rhodes Scholars, were<br />held in St John's, I Halifax, Montreal, Kingston, Ottawa, London, Winnipeg and Vancouver; and a<br />major dinner, with special guests including Ralph Henson's daughter and six Foundation Scholars,<br />took place in Toronto at St Michael's College during the autumn of 1989.</p>
        <p>That Extra Dimension<br />No account of the experiences of Rhodes Scholars in Oxford would be complete without<br />acknowledging the warm friendship and gracious hospitality, extended so freely to them, by<br />successive chatelaines of Rhodes House. Whether our particular memory is for someone named<br />Wylie, Allen, Williams, Fletcher or Kenny, the impression of kindness and friendly concern runs<br />through it as a common thread. It constituted a personal dimension, which neither Rhodes' largesse<br />nor the best efforts of his dedicated Trustees and Officers could ever have hoped to provide.<br />It is good to be able to report that, within the constraints imposed by geography, this pleasant<br />tradition has been maintained in Canada. Throughout my stewardship I have enjoyed the<br />wholehearted encouragement and dedicated participation of my wife, Joy. Her secretarial skills and<br />her encyclopedic familiarity with the Rhodes community have been invaluable and have greatly<br />facilitated administration of the Scholarship program. In addition, she has welcomed a number of<br />Foundation Scholars to our home and maintained friendly contact with them, both during and after<br />their stay, thus providing something of that personal touch so special to our own Oxford experience.<br />[...]<br />It is gratifying to realize that there are now more than 200 Canadian Rhodes Scholars sharing that<br />&amp;quot;justified pride&amp;quot;, in a project which I have always regarded as a logical expansion of the Rhodes<br />ideal. I hope that recent and upcoming generations of Rhodes Scholars, both men and women, will<br />become similarly motivated. Should this transpire, something which began, simply, as a token or<br />gesture of appreciation, but has now matured into a respected international institution, will continue<br />to serve and flourish.<br />E Michael Howarth (Ontario &amp;amp; Queen's 1949)<br />May, 1993<br />Fifty Years &amp;amp; Counting !!<br />Directors attending the recent annual meeting of the Canadian Rhodes Scholars Foundation were<br />pleasantly surprised to learn that 2006 marked the fiftieth anniversary of our scholarship program.<br />This milestone was recorded without undue fanfare, but those present felt that this enterprise,<br />sponsored at its origins by the Association of Canadian Rhodes Scholars, had fully justified the<br />inspiration and hopes of its inaugurators. Incidentally, the scholarships are the only activity engaged<br />in by the Association, which has any impact beyond the boundaries of the Rhodes Scholar<br />community.<br />Since its inception at the 1957 biennial in Ottawa, when then Association president, the late John L.<br />Stewart (Ontario and New College &rsquo;32) first broached the concept of an annual reciprocal<br />scholarship to a Canadian university, 78 awards have been made. Beginning in 1977, in harmony<br />with the extension of the Rhodes, women have been eligible and successful on 23 occasions.<br />A word about the Foundation&rsquo;s finances. Association members will perhaps be surprised to learn<br />that the Foundation has never sought, nor received, any subsidy from the Association. From the<br />outset, it has paid its own way. Officers and Directors serve without remuneration, personally<br />absorbing travelling and other expenses incurred on behalf of the Foundation. No outlay has ever<br />been made for staff, office rental or furnishings. As a result of several generous bequests, an<br />investment portfolio, valued at $1,124,000 on June 30 2006, has been built up. The annual income<br />from this (currently $30,000) finances one of the scholarships and covers such modest<br />administrative expenses as audit and investment management fees, postage, etc. As a result every</p>
        <p>dollar contributed, in its entirety, helps to finance a scholarship! My inquiries confirm that few, if<br />any, charitable organizations could make a similar claim.<br />Scholarship winners represent a wide range of colleges, with BNC, Univ, and Balliol leading the<br />way with five each, followed closely at four each by LMH and St. Cat&rsquo;s. Toronto has played host to<br />twenty-three Oxonians, followed by UBC (fourteen), McGill (eleven) and Queen&rsquo;s (nine). Unlike<br />Canadian and American Rhodes Scholars, relatively few Foundation scholars have sought a niche in<br />the groves of academe. Geology, geography, economics and medicine, in that order, have been the<br />most popular disciplines. One offshoot of the program, not foreseen and certainly not intended, has<br />been the predilection of a surprisingly large number of winners for permanent residence in Canada.<br />If thought about at all, it was probably assumed that they, like their Canadian Rhodes counterparts,<br />would return home on completion of their studies. This has not been the case. Of seventy who have<br />gone down, after obtaining a Canadian degree, eighteen (roughly 25%) have chosen to pursue their<br />careers and establish their homes in Canada. The comparable figure for Canadian Rhodes remaining<br />in, or returning to, the UK, is of the order of 2%, predominantly composed of academics, four of<br />whom, currently, have posts in Oxford.<br />On a more personal note, it has been my enjoyable experience to get to know most of these &ldquo;new<br />Canadians&rdquo; over the years. Perhaps, therefore, I can be forgiven a smidgen of guilty satisfaction<br />satisfaction that young people of such calibre, privilege and promise, have, despite many interesting<br />options open to them, decided to vote for Canada with their feet.<br />In his forward to a 1985 register of Foundation scholars, the late Francis Leddy (Saskatchewan and<br />Exeter, &rsquo;33) wrote:<br />&amp;quot;We feel much satisfaction that the original inspiration has prospered over the years and justified<br />pride that Canada, alone among the Rhodes constituencies, provides such reciprocal scholarships, in<br />grateful recognition of our own large debt to Oxford.&amp;quot;<br />Judging by the generous response to the recent campaign and the encouraging increase in the<br />number of younger contributors, Leddy&rsquo;s comments still resonate. Hopefully, our unique<br />scholarship program, which I have always regarded as a logical extension of the Rhodes ideal, will<br />continue to flourish, as it embarks on its second half-century.<br />September, 2006<br />Michael Howarth (Ontario and Queen&rsquo;s, 1949)<br />Founding Director and Secretary-Treasurer, 1957-1993, Chairman, Investment Committee<br />Home History Current Newsletter CRSF Scholarship Board of Directors Contact Us<br />Privacy State</p>
