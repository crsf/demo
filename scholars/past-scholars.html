				<p>Mr. Cock graduated from Oxford with first class honours in French and Linguistics.  He is studying for a Masters in Public Affairs at the University of Ottawa.  His studies have covered a wide range of disciplines in the field, with a specialisation in trade policy and, in particular, the implications of the Brexit for UK trade policy beyond the March 2019 negotiation deadline.  As part of his MA course, this year, Mr. Cock is working for the political section of the US Embassy, in Ottawa.  He thinks it most likely he will seek employment with the UK Government after graduation, although he has not ruled out a future in Canada.  The photo was taken in Scheldt, British Columbia, with the spoils of his first-ever fishing trip.  He made the journey with the scholarship travel grant.</p>
